# student_lesson_autogeneration
[Insight AI Fellowship Project] The purpose of this project is to explore approaches to auto-generate lessons for learners on Khan Academy. There are currently millions of learners using Khan Academy, but because of the large variety of content available, learners can easily lose track of how to progress through the product. As learners progress through the content, their skill level changes and they need to find content to match their level.  


### Goal
The model built will learn how highly-motivated learners progress through Khan Academy on their own, and use that information to curate a set of lesson for active learners.  

The input for the model are the series of lessons prior to the target lesson. And we want to validate the performance based on how well the model is able to predict subsequent lessons that the learner chooses.
